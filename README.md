# Weather Dashboard

This web application allows users to search for weather data for a specific city/place using the OpenWeather API.

The application shows current weather and a five day forecast including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index, and makes use of the weather icons for a clearer user interface. When a user searches for a city, that city is saved to local storage and a button is created for easier access to the weather results the next time they use the application.
